# JSON Linter

This is a solution to [John Crickett's Coding Challenge #2 - Build a JSON Parser](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-2) written in Golang.

In the source code, you will notice that I call the main application a linter (as opposed to a parser per John's Challenge). It made more sense to me to call this a linter as the task is to create an application to validate whether a passed in JSON file is valid or not.

To achieve this, the validator uses a `lexer` and a `parser` to help determine if the JSON is valid or not.

## Pre-requisites

Requires you to have [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed.

To run the files using `make`, make sure you have [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed as well.

The Makefile includes a `lint` command which depends on [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint). If you want to use `make lint`, then install this dependency.

## Installation

1. Clone and navigate into the repository
2. Build the executable binaries using `make build`
3. The binaries can be found in the `bin` directory of the repo

## Usage

```bash
# Build the Binary
make build

# Navigate to the bin directory where the binary is stored
cd ./bin

# Execute the application
./jl <json filepath>
```

## Notes / Background

### JSON Structure

At the top level, a `JSON` file can either be:
- `object`
- `array`
- These are actually just `values`, so at a high level, the root element of a JSON file is just a `value` (see below for more info on values)

`object`
- An unordered set of `key`-`value` pairs
	- Can also refer to each `key`-`value` pair as a `property`
		- The `key` is always a string
		- Refer to notes on `value` for the types
	- An object con contain 0 or more `properties`
- Begins w/ a left brace `{`
- Ends w/ a right brace `}`
- Each key is followed by a colon `:`
- `properties` (except for the last one) are separated by a comma `,`

`array`
- An ordered set of `value`s
	- An array can contain 0 or more `value`s
- Begins w/ a left bracket `[`
- Ends w/ a right bracket `]`
- Each `value` (except for last one) are separated by a comma `,`
- Refer to notes on `value` for types

`value`
- `object`
- `array`
- `string` (wrapped in double quotes)
- `number`
- boolean (`true` or `false`)
- `null`

### Lexical Analysis / Tokenization / Scanning

During `Lexical Analysis`, a `lexer` (a.k.a. `tokenizer` / `scanner`) takes a sequence of characters as input, and outputs the series of lexical `tokens`

Think of the process of `Lexical Analysis` as taking a sequence of characters and classifying the important parts

```txt
string -> LEXER -> tokens
```

What is a `Lexeme`?
- A `lexeme` is the actual sequence of characters in the source code that matches the pattern for a particular token.
- The smallest unit of meaning in the source code (the raw, unclassified piece of code being analyzed)
- `Lexeme`s are often the input substrings that are recognized by the lexical analyzer based on the language's syntax rules
- Ex. `var x = 10;` => Lexemes: `var`, `x`, `=`, `10`, `;`

What is a `Token`?
- In the context of `Lexical Analysis`, a `token` is a categorized and labeled unit of meaning that results from the `lexical analysis` of `lexemes`.
- The `token` represents the classification of the lexeme based on the language's syntax rules
- Often includes a type (e.g. keyword, identifier, operator, etc.), and an optional attribute value
- A `token` consists of the combination of a `lexeme`, its `token type` / classification, and can include optional info, such as a value for a string or numerical `lexeme`

Example: Tokenize the following JSON object:
```json
{
	"hello": "world",
	"happy": true,
	"fruits": ["apple", "banana", "orange"],
	"numbers": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

| Lexeme    | Classification / Token Type | Value   |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `{`       | LBRACE                      | n/a     |
| `hello`   | STR                         | hello   |
| `:`       | COLON                       | n/a     |
| `world`   | STR                         | world   |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `happy`   | STR                         | happy   |
| `:`       | COLON                       | n/a     |
| `true`    | TRUE                        | true    |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `fruits`  | STR                         | fruits  |
| `:`       | COLON                       | n/a     |
| `[`       | LBRACKET                    | n/a     |
| `apple`   | STR                         | apple   |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `banana`  | STR                         | banana  |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `orange`  | STR                         | orange  |
| `]`       | RBRACKET                    | n/a     |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `numbers` | STR                         | numbers |
| `:`       | COLON                       | n/a     |
| `[`       | LBRACKET                    | n/a     |
| `1`       | NUM                         | 1       |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `2`       | NUM                         | 2       |
| `,`       | COMMA                       | n/a     |
| `3`       | NUM                         | 3       |
| `]`       | RBRACKET                    | n/a     |
| `}`       | RBRACE                      | n/a     |

### Syntactical Analysis / Parsing

Parsing is the process of recognizing the shape of an input string.

During `Syntactical Analysis`, a `parser` takes a series of tokens, and outputs an `Abstract Syntax Tree` (`AST`)

```txt
tokens -> PARSER -> Abstract Syntax Tree
```

What is an `Abstract Syntax Tree`?
- An `AST` is an intermediate representation of source code as a tree structure
- The `AST` represents the hierarchial structure and semantics of the code
- A compiler will use an `AST` to compile a language down to machine code.
